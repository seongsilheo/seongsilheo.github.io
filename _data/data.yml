    title: About Me
    summary:
      I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz. I am a member of [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/) advised by [Professor Roberto Manduchi](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manduchi/). I am currently working on Gaze-contingent screen magnification project for visually impaired people. My research interests lie broadly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, time series analysis, object detection, computer vision, IoT healthcare, assistive technology, and philosophy of science.
      <br><br>
      I have received my Master's degree in Artificail Intelligence from Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea. I was a member of Machine Intelligence Lab advised by Jaekoo Lee. My master's thesis was about Learning from time Series. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea.
