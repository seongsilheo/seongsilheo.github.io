    title: About Me
    summary:
      I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging innovative AI technologies for positive societal impact, promoting equitable opportunities, and driving meaningful change toward societal well-being. My main interest is about leveraging non-verbal cues to gain deeper insights into human behavior patterns and understanding how humans think and act ðŸ‘€ðŸ§ . With over 7 years of experience in machine learning, I specialize in projects involving eye gaze movement, behavioral data, time series data, and multi-modal approaches. While I enjoy exploring machine learning methods, I also prioritize understanding and applying domain knowledge to develop practical and impactful solutions.
