career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary:
      I am passionate about leveraging human-centered AI to drive positive societal impact, create emotionally intelligent systems, and promote equitable opportunities for all. My core interest lies in utilizing deep behavioral insights from non-verbal cues (👀🧠) to better understand human thought processes, interactions, and decision-making patterns.
      <br>
          With over 7 years of experience in machine learning, I specialize in multimodal AI, including eye gaze movement, behavioral analysis, and time-series data. My approach integrates domain expertise with AI, ensuring that technology is not just innovative but also meaningful, ethical, and socially responsible. I focus on building tech with intuition and purpose, designing systems that enhance adaptive interfaces, user-centric applications, and inclusive, empathetic interactions.
      <br>
          By bridging foundational AI research and real-world applications, my work ensures that AI evolves beyond raw intelligence, fostering human-AI collaboration that is intuitive, responsible, and transformative. I believe in shaping AI that respects and amplifies human cognition, empowering people through technology while keeping the ethical and emotional dimensions of AI at the forefront.
